      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;welcome-to-my-digital-garden&#34;&gt;Welcome to my digital garden!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Zhiyang and I am a computer science student at the National University of Singapore. At heart, I am a problem solver. The satisfaction of finding outside-of-the-box solutions has always fuelled my curiosity and drive. My passion for problem-solving led me to the field of computer science, where every line of code and algorithm presents a new challenge to conquer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am particularly passionate about algorithmic design and parallel computing, as they allow me to push the boundaries of efficiency and scalability. I enjoy leveraging on my skills in systems engineering to optimising complex computations and solve problems faster and more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
