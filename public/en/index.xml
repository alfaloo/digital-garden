      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;welcome-to-my-digital-garden&#34;&gt;Welcome to my digital garden!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Zhiyang and I am a computer science student at the National University of Singapore. At heart, I am a problem solver. The satisfaction of finding outside-of-the-box solutions has always fuelled my curiosity and drive. My passion for problem-solving led me to the field of computer science, where every line of code and algorithm presents a new challenge to conquer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, you can browse through my experiences, cool projects, various writings, and digital illustrations (all the graphics on this site was designed by me!). I hope you enjoy your visit and feel free to connect with me on my socials!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
